        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Prabhjot Singh, a Computer Science student with a passion for
          building impactful digital experiences. As a self-taught full-stack
          developer, I specialize in crafting intuitive frontends with React and
          building scalable backends with Node.js and Express. I love solving
          real-world problems with code and continuously pushing my boundaries
          through hands-on projects. Whether it's creating responsive web
          applications, optimizing performance, or learning new technologies â€”
          I'm always excited to grow and innovate. Currently, I'm seeking
          opportunities to collaborate, intern, or contribute to meaningful tech
          projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, exploring tech trends,
          and diving into manhua or story-rich games that fuel my creativity.
